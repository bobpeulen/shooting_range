# Shooting Range
Repo containing development and testing (private) pictures of shooting range. Pictures used are very cluttered.

## Image processing using CV2 / Oracle Data Science
As part of a demo, images are processed in steps. Starting with cropping the image based on the largest circle, removing noise, masking images, detecting yellow areas, untill adding circles to the holes and scoring the holes.

# Steps:
- Create and publish custom conda environment
- Step by step image processing and scoring of target holes
- Example app using Gradio, running all step by step in one file
